\description{
Monocle3 aims to learn how cells transition through a
biological program of gene expression changes in an experiment. Each cell
can be viewed as a point in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension
describes the expression of a different gene. Identifying the program of
gene expression changes is equivalent to learning a \emph{trajectory} that
the cells follow through this space. However, the more dimensions there are
in the analysis, the harder the trajectory is to learn. Fortunately, many
genes typically co-vary with one another, and so the dimensionality of the
data can be reduced with a wide variety of different algorithms. Monocle3
provides two different algorithms for dimensionality reduction via
\code{reduce_dimension} (UMAP and tSNE). The function
\code{reduce_dimension} is the second step in the trajectory building
process after \code{preprocess_cds}.

UMAP is implemented from the package uwot.
